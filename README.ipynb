It is largely based on the book by [Nathan Ida](http://www.scitechpublishing.com/ida_9781613530061.htm \"Nathan Ida, Sensors and Actuators 9781613530023\"). The lectures notes are written using the [Jupyter IPython Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), part of the [Python ecosystem for scientific computing]( http://scipy.org/ ). You can view these lectures in different ways: simply read on line by clicking on the links below; or download a single notebook or all the stuff or yet fork this entire repository using the GitHub resources and run the notebooks in your computer or in the cloud. I hope this material is useful to you and I am open to suggestions or comments.\n",

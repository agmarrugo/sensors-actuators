**Notes on Sensors and Actuators with ipython notebooks**

Andrés Marrugo, PhD


This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks in the form of lecture notes and engineering calculations for the course IMTR Z03A Sensors and Actuators taught at the [Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar](http://www.utb.edu.co/). It is largely based on the book by [Nathan Ida](http://www.scitechpublishing.com/ida_9781613530061.htm "Nathan Ida, Sensors and Actuators 9781613530023"). The lectures notes are written using the [Jupyter IPython Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), part of the [Python ecosystem for scientific computing]( http://scipy.org/ ). You can view these lectures in different ways: simply read on line by clicking on the links below; or download a single notebook or all the stuff or yet fork this entire repository using the GitHub resources and run the notebooks in your computer or in the cloud. I hope this material is useful to you and I am open to suggestions or comments.

This work was inspired by the lecture notes on [Scientific Computing for Biomechanics and Motor Control by Marcos Duarte](https://github.com/demotu/BMC). This is a work in progress.

Introduction
------------

We will be using Jupyter Python notebooks as a numerical computing and graphical platform for solving many problems in the course. To avoid installing Jupyter Python locally, I encourage you to use Google Colab.
